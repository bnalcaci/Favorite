# Path of Exile 
 
Path of Exile is a free-to-play action role-playing video game developed and published by Grinding Gear Games. On this site I will be sharing some thing I enjoy about the game.

## 1. The Game is free to play!
You dont have to pay anything to play the game and it isn't pay to win meaning that you cannot progress past people by paying money. The game is mostly supported by cosmetics!
Even though the [cosmetics](https://www.pathofexile.com/purchase) are expensive, they dont affect gameplay at all!

## 2. Customization!
The game has many characters and different abilities and skills to utilize.

## 3. Tons of Content
The game has a campaign that includes 10 acts and a very extensive endgame with countless of hours of content to play through!

## 4. Another Free Play Game Links
Here are another free games you can [play](https://freegames.org/)

## 5. Look to picture and decide which video game is best for you?
